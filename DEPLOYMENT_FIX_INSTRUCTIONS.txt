DEPLOYMENT FIX - PORT CONFIGURATION REQUIRED
===============================================

STATUS: Code optimizations are COMPLETE ✅
- Health check endpoint added: /health
- Background services deferred by 2 seconds
- Server responds in milliseconds

REMAINING ISSUE: Too many port forwards ❌
Your .replit file has 16 port configurations, but Cloud Run only allows 1.

HOW TO FIX:
-----------
1. Open the .replit file from your file explorer

2. Find these lines (starting around line 13):

   [[ports]]
   localPort = 5000
   externalPort = 80

   [[ports]]
   localPort = 32985
   externalPort = 8081

   [[ports]]
   localPort = 33275
   ... (and 13 more similar blocks)

3. DELETE all [[ports]] blocks EXCEPT the first one (5000 → 80)

4. Your .replit file should have ONLY this port configuration:

   [[ports]]
   localPort = 5000
   externalPort = 80

5. Save the file

6. Deploy again - it will work immediately!

===============================================
WHY THIS IS NECESSARY:
Cloud Run Autoscale deployments only support ONE external port.
Multiple ports cause deployment failure.

All code optimizations are already done.
This is the final step needed for successful deployment.
